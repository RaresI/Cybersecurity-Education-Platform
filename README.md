In my project, developed in 2023, I started building a web application, learning about the fundamentals of both Front-End and Back-End development. 
Key frameworks employed in this venture include Node.js for server-side scripting, Express for routing and middleware management, MongoDB as the database system.
Also, Mongoose for elegant MongoDB object modeling, Passport for user authentication, and Ejs for server-side templating.
Throughout the process, I grasped the importance of database management, specifically in storing sensitive user information such as usernames, emails, and passwords securely. 
This involved implementing robust hashing algorithms to ensure the confidentiality of user passwords during transit and storage within the database.
