In my project, developed in 2023, I started building a web application, learning about the fundamentals of both Front-End and Back-End development. 
This website includes a various number of courses from which the user may choose to start. It also has a section of the latest news in Cybersecurity.
Added also an API with which the users can search directly from the web app anything they want on Google.
It also presents a selection of challenges or small tests from which the users may test their knowledge.
Key frameworks employed in this venture include Node.js for server-side scripting, Express for routing and middleware management, MongoDB as the database system.
Also, Mongoose for elegant MongoDB object modeling, Passport for user authentication, and Ejs for server-side templating.
Throughout the process, I grasped the importance of database management, specifically in storing sensitive user information such as usernames, emails, and passwords securely. 
This involved implementing robust hashing algorithms to ensure the confidentiality of user passwords during transit and storage within the database.
